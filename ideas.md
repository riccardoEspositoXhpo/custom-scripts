# Ideas for future scripts and projects

- ChatGPT style AI that can replace my arch linux google search
- automate arch installation and post-installation via shell script
- better management and system restore
- how to back up app settings smartly - I think I got that figured out via symlinks...
- automate system update... via notification daemon or something?

## Ideas for this repo

- should contain a large archinstall script done by myself
- should contain modularized installers for features, applications, etc. - should be driven by config.
- can be run as single modules, no need to panic
