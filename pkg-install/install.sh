# Allora devo fare un loop di directories.

# Per ogni directory devo

# crete some kind of pkg file that contains the custom intall script...
# maybe I just run the install script
# perhaps I just extrapolate some useful menus and functions in the main directory and that's it... just source them e via tanto install sh ainÂ´t goin anywhere

# Questo e il main script.
# devo stabilire un order of operations perhaps con il dir name order o perhaps in some other way with a map right here.. or a config file. whatever, something.

# questo scirpt fa poco o niente, lo runni ma lui gira e fa solo tipo STATZ collecting no...
